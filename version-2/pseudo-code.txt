==================================
🧠 VERSION 2 PSEUDO-CODE WORKSHEET
==================================

This is our WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, HOW framework for working with data:

1. WHAT data should we store & retrieve?
   What kind of HTTP request do we need to send, and to what API endpoint?
   If we are sending a POST request, what do we need to send in the request body, and what is the data type?
   What would we get back in the response, and what is the data t ype?

2. WHEN should we store & retrieve the data?
   What event or user action is the trigger, such as clicking a button, submitting a form, or loading a page?

3. WHERE does this happen in the code?
   What component, page or function?

4. HOW do we accomplish this?
   What steps do we need to take?
   Do we need to...
   - make any GET or POST requests to an API endpoint?
   - render anything in JSX?
   - make any functions? If so, when would we call those functions?
   - use any useState or useEffect hooks?
     Remember: This is pseudo-code. Don't write code yet — just outline the actions in plain language.

✨ YOUR TASK: Fill in the answers to each WHAT/WHEN/WHERE/HOW question below for the 3 pieces of data.

==================================
📊 FORM DATA
==================================

========================
🔶 STORING FORM DATA
========================

❓ WHAT...
TYPE OF HTTP REQUEST (GET OR POST): ------ Post
API ENDPOINT: ------ /add-one-user (Base URL + endpoint)

REQUEST BODY DATA TYPE (if applicable): ------ JSON object
REQUEST BODY (if applicable): ------ 
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "country_name": "Germany",
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "bio": "A little about Alice"
}

RESPONSE DATA TYPE: ------ String
RESPONSE: ------ 
Success! User has been added.

❓ WHEN: ------ When the user submits the form

❓ WHERE: ------ SavedCountries.jsx

❓ HOW:
Step 1: Create useState to store form inputs (name, country_name, email, bio).
Step 2: On form submit, prevent page refresh.
Step 3: Send a POST request to /add-one-user with the form state as the JSON body.
Step 4: Read the response (success message).
Step 5: Clear the form OR show a success message in the UI.

========================
🔶 RETRIEVING FORM DATA
========================

❓ WHAT...
TYPE OF HTTP REQUEST (GET OR POST): ------ GET
API ENDPOINT: ------ /get-newest-user

REQUEST BODY DATA TYPE (if applicable): ------ N/A
REQUEST BODY (if applicable): ------

RESPONSE DATA TYPE: ------ array of objects (JSON)
RESPONSE: ------
[
  {
    "user_id": 42,
    "name": "John Smith",
    "country_name": "Canada",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "bio": "Another bio"
  }
]

❓ WHEN:  When the Saved Countries page loads (so you can display the newest user), and/or right after successfully 
submitting the form.

❓ WHERE: In the Saved Countries page/component where you display the “newest user” (the same page as the form).

❓ HOW: After someone fills out the form and submits it: 
Step 1: Create state like newestUser.
Step 2: Use useEffect to run on page load.
Step 3: Send GET request to /get-newest-user.
Step 4: Save the response into newestUser state.
Step 5: Render the newest user info in JSX (name/email/country/bio).
Step 6 (optional): If you also want all users, use GET /get-all-users instead.

===================================
📊 SAVED COUNTRIES DATA
===================================

========================
🔶 STORING SAVED COUNTRIES DATA
========================

❓ WHAT...
TYPE OF HTTP REQUEST (GET OR POST): ------ POST
API ENDPOINT: ------ /save-one-country

REQUEST BODY DATA TYPE (if applicable): ------ Object
REQUEST BODY (if applicable): 
{
  "country_name": "Brazil"
}

RESPONSE DATA TYPE: ------ String
RESPONSE: ------ Success! The country is saved.

❓ WHEN: ------ When the user clicks a Save button for a country.

❓ WHERE: ------ Country Card 

❓ HOW:
Step 1: Make a “Save” button for each country in JSX.
Step 2: When clicked, run a function like handleSave(countryName).
Step 3: In that function, POST to /save-one-country with { country_name: countryName }.
Step 4: After success, update your saved countries state (either re-fetch saved list OR add locally).
Step 5: Update UI to show it’s saved (button changes / icon filled).

========================
🔶 RETRIEVING SAVED COUNTRIES DATA
========================

❓ WHAT...
TYPE OF HTTP REQUEST (GET OR POST): ------ GET
API ENDPOINT: ------ /get-all-saved-countries

REQUEST BODY DATA TYPE (if applicable): ------ N/A
REQUEST BODY (if applicable): ------ N/A

RESPONSE DATA TYPE: ------ array of objects
RESPONSE: ------ 
[
  {
    "country_name": "Japan"
  },
  {
    "country_name": "Germany"
  }
]

❓ WHEN: ------ When the Saved Countries page loads, and/or when you need to show which countries are already saved.

❓ WHERE: ------ SavedCountries

❓ HOW:
Step 1: Create state like savedCountries.
Step 2: On page load (useEffect), GET /get-all-saved-countries.
Step 3: Store results in savedCountries.
Step 4: Render the list in JSX (map over savedCountries).

=================================
📊 COUNTRY COUNTS DATA
=================================

========================
🔶 STORING & RETRIEVING COUNTRY COUNTS DATA
========================
NOTE: We combine storing & retrieving country counts data into one section because they always happen together. Each time we look up a country’s view count, we also need to increase it and save the new total.

❓ WHAT...
TYPE OF HTTP REQUEST (GET OR POST): ------ POST
API ENDPOINT: ------ /update-one-country-count

REQUEST BODY DATA TYPE (if applicable): ------ object
REQUEST BODY (if applicable): ------ {
  "country_name": "France"
}

RESPONSE DATA TYPE: ------ object
RESPONSE: ------ {
  "count": 3
}

❓ WHEN: ------ When the user views a country (example: clicks a country card and lands on the Country Detail page).
Basically: “a country detail view happened” is the trigger.

❓ WHERE: ------ In CountryDetail page/component (because that’s the “view” event).
inside a useEffect that runs when the detail page loads or when the route param changes.

❓ HOW:
Step 1: When CountryDetail loads, grab the country name (from the route param or passed state).
Step 2: Immediately POST to /update-one-country-count with { country_name: countryName }.
Step 3: Read the response { count: number }.
Step 4: Store that count in state like viewCount.
Step 5: Render “Views: {viewCount}” in JSX on the CountryDetail page.
